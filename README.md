This repository contains code for the successful completion of tasks in the Communication Systems Lab using MATLAB Simulink. The lab is divided into three parts, where we explore different aspects of communication systems such as Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), Oscilloscope, and Spectrum Analyzer.

## Lab 1: Oscilloscope and Spectrum Analyzer

In this lab, we learn the basic operations of oscilloscope and spectrum analyzer, and understand the concept of dBm and dBV. The repo contains Simulink models for different tasks involving signal generation, manipulation, and observation on Scope and Spectrum Analyzer.

## Lab 2: Amplitude Modulation using Simulink

This lab focuses on the simulation and study of modulation and demodulation of AM signals. The repo contains Simulink models for generating AM modulated signals with various modulation indices, observing the signals on Scope and Spectrum Analyzer, and analyzing the output in time and frequency domains.

## Lab 3: FM Modulation and Demodulation using Simulink

The third lab is about simulating and studying FM signal modulation and demodulation. We observe the impact of amplitude and frequency of the message signal on FM signals. The repo contains Simulink models for building FM modulated signals using a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), constructing a phase-locked loop (PLL) for FM demodulation, and observing the demodulated signal on the Oscilloscope and Spectrum Analyzer.

## Getting Started

To use the Simulink models in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the repository folder.
3. Open the desired Simulink model (`.slx` file) and run the simulation.
4. Analyze the output on the respective instruments such as Oscilloscope, Spectrum Analyzer, or other scopes provided in the models.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (preferably R2021a or later)
- Simulink
